                <h3>The Designer</h3>

                <p>
                    Hi, my name is Mia Lew and I am a pansexual, White, Chinese, and Jewish, American. I am also a junior in college majoring in Graphic Communication with a minor in Event Planning and Experience Management. I have always had a love for crafts and creating, along with a passion for entrepreneurship. Starting this brand has allowed me to continue making because now I have a reason to. I love getting to share my art on this platform and I hope you all can enjoy it too. I'm so excited to see where this journey takes me!
xoxo, Mia Lew :)

                <h3>The Brand</h3>

                <p> This business started almost a year ago in the midst of a global pandemic. I needed a place to hone my time to use my creative abilities, thus creating Mia Makes Ice! My jewelry and projects currently consist of acrylic, clay, resin, and bead work to create my designs. As of late, the resin has allowed me to fully explore my creative side during quarantine while creating pieces people gag over.
