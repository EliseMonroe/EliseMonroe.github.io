                <h3>Community Care</h3>
                 <p>San Luis Obispo and it's neighboring cities are truly special places. At the start of the pandemic all of its members were hurting, some more than others. The crafting community came together to help these people the only way they knew how, creating. All pop-ups hoested by Mia Makes Ice take a percentage of all the vendors sales to give to different organizations. Along with funds, those attending are asked to donate physical items for different causes. This has included goods for the houseless and toys for the Boys and Girls Club as well as more to come. Although this won't fix the systemic problems our community faces, it would be unjust to not help those around us any way we could.</p>
